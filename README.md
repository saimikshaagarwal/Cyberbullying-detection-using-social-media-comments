## Cyberbullying-detection-using-social-media-comments

**Cyberbullying**, the act of harassing or intimidating others through digital platforms, has become a serious concern with the widespread use of social media. Its psychological effects can be significant, especially among vulnerable individuals.  

This project aims to address this issue through the application of a traditional Machine Learning model, to detect cyberbullying from text data. In this project, a machine learning model is 
implemented to classify social media text from categories: hate speech, offensive, and normal to: cyberbullying and non cyberbullying. The project focuses on structured feature extraction 
and classical ML methods. 

**The Logistic Regression model**, trained on TF-IDF-transformed comment tokens, reached an accuracy of 85.66%. It demonstrated reliable performance in classifying cyberbullying comments and laid the foundation for more nuanced detection methods.

Overall, the project contributes to ethical AI ML development and offers a scalable starting point for real-world cyberbullying mitigation tools.
